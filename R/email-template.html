<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>We're happy to announce several upcoming events this week! And we're also super excited to have (finally) set up a formal mailing list (to which you've been added), our website is updated with calendar integration, and we now have an AU address at <a href="https://cru.au.dk">cru.au.dk</a>!!</p>

<p>Although this email announcement is a bit short notice for some of the events, we hope that you can attend some of them!</p>

<p>More information about the events (among other things) can be found on our website <a href="https://cru.au.dk">cru.au.dk</a>. There is also a calendar you can <a href="https://au-cru.github.io/site/more-info/#add-calendar">import</a>! And if you want to help us out, fill out <a href="https://au-cru.github.io/site/surveys/">these surveys</a> so we know what everyone is interested in.</p>

<p>If you know anyone who is interested in these events, forward this email and get them to <a href="https://tinyletter.com/au-cru">subscribe to our mailing list</a>! If you don't want to be on this list, unsubscribe with the link below.</p>
