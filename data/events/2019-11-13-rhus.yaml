  **Predicting milk production using R**

  In a dairy company like Arla Foods it is crucial to know how much milk our cows will produce in order to do production planning. 
  In this talk I will present how we have used R to build a forecasting model, 
  and how we have taken that model from proof-of-concept to production where it is now producing weekly forecasts for our planning department.
