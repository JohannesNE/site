description: >
  The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize the workshop participants
  with best practices and tools in modern research software development. The main focus
  is on professional tools for efficiently writing and maintaining research software.
  Since most research code is developed in a collaborative setting, we will discuss tools and
  workflows which facilitate this process. Most of the content is also relevant to a single researcher.
