name: "Introduction to the community"
description: >
  We're starting up a community of researchers who use open software in their
  work (e.g. R or Python). We have plans on running frequent but short training
  sessions (e.g. 'Data Visualization in R'), on hosting more intensive workshops,
  and on informal hang outs and support sessions. We will introduce the community
  and what we want or are planning to do. We'd love to have you join us and
  get involved!
