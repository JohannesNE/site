  **Using R to fail fast: Driving data acceptance in industry**


  Using data in a traditional value based company can be taunting task.

  **bigstatsr: Out-of-memory matrices**

  R package {bigstatsr} provides a special class of matrix that can be used to store some data in a matrix-like format __on disk__
  but to access it almost as if it were in memory. 
  It is particularly useful when you analyze large matrices and when you want to parallelize your code. 
  Various efficient statistical and helper functions are provided for this data format.
