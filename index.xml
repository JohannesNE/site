      <title>Creating your own functions in R</title>

      <description>Resources for learning and help Here for resources
 Session content Before we begin, we’ll set up an R project, create a folder named R/, and then create a new file in the R/ folder of the project.
Basic structure of a function In R, all actions are functions. For instance, the + is a function, mean() is a function, [] is a function, and so on. So creating your functions can make doing your work easier and more efficient.</description>

      <description>About Vision Reproducibility, open scientific practices, and analytic transparency are increasingly being requested or required of scientists and researchers, but training on these on topics is severely lacking. Nor has the culture around sharing of code and skills, or even the recognition that these concepts are important for the health of science, dramatically changed.
Our vision is to create a community of (open) research software users at Aarhus University and the surrounding area to share, learn, and support each other, so that we may better use our tools in our research.</description>
